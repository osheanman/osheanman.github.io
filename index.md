# Portfolio

Howdy! My name is Muhammad Oshean Lehrmann, and I have recently graduated from UC Berkeley. This website showcases both the biology and the computer science projects I have worked on during my education, and will be updated with any personal projects I start moving forward. Some projects cannot be shown in some capacity in order to hide potential solutions for future classes.

## Work Experience

### Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium

Undergraduate Research Intern
06/2021-08/2021
Sarasota, FL
- Worked with coral disease data using R in order to model the impacts of diseases such as Stony coral tissue loss disease, monitor the health of corals, and examine the efficacy of disease treatments.
- Designed a corallivorous snail prey preference experiment using flumes of water to deliver chemical cues to the snail species _Coralliophila abbreviata_ to determine if it was more likely to follow the flow towards the coral species of _Acropora cervicornis_, _Montipora capricornis_, or _Montastraea cavernosa_ and presented my findings.
- Aquatic lab maintenance involved coral husbandry and water quality testing
- Learned protocols for DNA extractions, PCR, gel electrophoresis
